        Brent Buell is a producer, director, playwright and novelist. He is
        co-producer of A24's movie <i>Sing Sing</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For ten years, Brent directed theater in New York's maximum-security
        prisons with plays ranging from John Steinbeck's
        <i>Of Mice and Men</i> to original works by prisoners. Those plays
        earned praise from critics, including from <i>The New York Times</i>.
        His comedy, <i>Breakin' the Mummy's Code</i>, premiered inside Sing Sing
        Correctional Facility and was the subject of an <i>Esquire</i> feature
        by bestselling author, John Richardson. That production was the
        inspiration for the movie <i>Sing Sing</i> directed by Greg Kwedar and
        starring Oscar-nominated Colman Domingo and Clarence Maclin. Buell is
        portrayed by Oscar-nominated Paul Raci. Buell's experiences provided the
        basis for his chapter "Drama in the Big House" in the book
        <i>Performing New Lives: Prison Theater</i> by Jonathan Shailor. (here's
